Title: My First Game
Date: 2024-02-06

###Starting the planning of my first ever full game

Today marks the start of the planning of my first full length game. I am not sure how long this will take me but I am hoping to have it out before 2 years are up.

For now the project will be called.

**Project Ephemera**

Set in Ancient Rome this game will take inspiration from games like:

- Silent Hill
- Amnesia: The Dark Descent
- Visage
- Resident Evil 7

This is a bold decision and it's one that I won't take lightly.

My plan is to bang out a prototype with placeholders and possibly shop it around. I will probably also start a Vlog (time depending).
